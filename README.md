## Overview

This project involves the comprehensive analysis of RNA-Seq data from the 1000 Genomes Project. The primary objective is to explore the impact of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) on gene expression levels across different populations. By leveraging tools such as `samtools`, `cufflinks`, and statistical methods like ANOVA, we aim to identify SNPs that significantly influence gene expression.

## Features

- **High-throughput RNA-Seq Data Analysis**: Efficiently processes RNA-Seq data using industry-standard tools.
- **Gene Expression Quantification**: Utilizes `cufflinks` for accurate transcript assembly and quantification.
- **Variant Impact Assessment**: Performs ANOVA to assess the impact of SNP variants (1/1, 1/0 or 0/1, 0/0) on gene expression.
  - **Homozygous Variants (1/1)**: Individuals who have two identical alleles for a particular SNP.
  - **Heterozygous Variants (1/0 or 0/1)**: Individuals who have two different alleles for a particular SNP.
  - **Homozygous Reference (0/0)**: Individuals who have two reference alleles, meaning they do not carry the variant.
- **Significance Filtering**: Applies statistical thresholds to identify SNPs with significant effects.
- **Reproducibility**: Includes detailed instructions and scripts to replicate the analysis.

## Data Sources

1. **1000 Genomes Project**: 
   - The 1000 Genomes Project provides comprehensive genomic data for a wide range of human populations. This project uses the variant data from the 1000 Genomes Project to classify samples based on their SNP variants.
   - **Website**: [1000 Genomes Project](http://www.internationalgenome.org/)

2. **GEUVADIS Project**:
   - The GEUVADIS (Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease) project provides RNA-Seq data and corresponding genotype data for human populations. It is an essential resource for studying the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression. This project uses GEUVADIS RNA-Seq data for quantifying gene expression levels.

3. **Annotation File**: 
   - To accurately quantify gene expression, the project utilizes an annotation file that provides detailed information on gene structures. The specific annotation file used is from Ensembl.
   - **Annotation File**: `Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.112.gtf.gz` from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org)
