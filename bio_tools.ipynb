    "## Samtools: Sorting and Indexing BAM Files\n",
    "\n",
    "`Samtools` is a suite of programs for interacting with high-throughput sequencing data. It is primarily used for processing and analyzing alignment files in BAM (Binary Alignment Map) format. In this notebook, we use `samtools` for two key tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorting BAM Files**: Sorting the alignment data by genomic coordinates. This step is crucial for subsequent analysis steps, such as variant calling and visualization.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Indexing BAM Files**: Creating an index for the sorted BAM files to allow for fast retrieval of data from specific regions of the genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commands Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sorting**: The `samtools sort` command is used to sort BAM files by genomic coordinates.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: The `samtools index` command creates an index for the sorted BAM files.\n",

    "## Cufflinks: Transcript Assembly and Quantification\n",
    "\n",
    "`Cufflinks` is a popular software tool used for assembling transcripts, estimating their abundances, and testing for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. It takes alignments from RNA-Seq reads and assembles them into a parsimonious set of transcripts. `Cufflinks` is particularly useful for identifying new isoforms and quantifying known transcripts, providing a measure of gene expression levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Functions of Cufflinks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transcript Assembly**: `Cufflinks` assembles RNA-Seq alignments into a set of transcripts, identifying both known and novel isoforms based on the reference genome and provided annotations.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Quantification**: It estimates the expression levels of each transcript in terms of Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM), which normalizes for transcript length and sequencing depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commands Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assembly**: The `cufflinks` command is used to assemble the transcripts from aligned reads (in BAM format) and quantify their expression levels.\n",
    "- **Reference Annotations**: The `-G` option allows the use of reference annotations to guide the assembly and quantification process, ensuring accurate estimation of known transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how `cufflinks` commands are used in this notebook:\n",

    "cufflinks -G /path/to/annotation.gtf -o /path/to/output/ -p 8 sorted_sample.bam\n"
